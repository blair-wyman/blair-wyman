# Strange Attractions

## *This is art, because I say so.*

### First 

I find the images generated by iterated equations profoundly beatiful and interesting, and I've hunted them with hungry eyes since before my career with IBM.  In fact, I probably owe my career to the esteemed Benoit Mandelbrot, as inner loops went from my hobby to my livelihood.

So, late in the last century, when I needed a test case to brutally abuse Java threads on a headless virtual machine, I wrote `laika2` to go look for some of the aforementioned beatiful images.

At the time, IBM let me hand out the complete source code at a COMMON conference, and as such I feel free to pick it up and play with it some more in my retirement.  

The first commit has the original Java source code, the original `com.ibm` package, a minimalist manifest for `java -jar`, and a simple `.maker` script fragment.  

To build and test, source the .maker from the command line and then run `java -jar jars/yourown.jar -h` for simple help text (or use `--help` for a much longer description with lots of multisyllabic words).
